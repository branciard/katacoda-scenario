# Congratulations, you've successfully made it through this tutorial!


The ffmpeg execution has been triggered thanks to a dapp smart contract, and it has been performed remotely by worker!

Just wait for the iExec V2 release to become a worker yourself, and monetize your idle cloud resources!


You can find the result of this tutorial in the ffmpeg branch of iexec-dapp-samples.

# Tutorial bonus: Monetize your new dapp with the current iExec V1 'The Wanderer'!

First, learn how to use the RLC token on our first tutorial: https://www.katacoda.com/sulliwane/scenarios/hello-world 

Tips: check the DAPP_PRICE variable in contracts/Ffmpeg.sol

Redeploy your new dapp to be monetized and you're all set to earn RLCs!
