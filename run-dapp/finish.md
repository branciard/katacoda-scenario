# Congratulations, you've successfully made it through this tutorial!

Now you know how to submit a work on a dapp from the [iExec Dapp Store](https://dapps.iex.ec).

In case you want to submit more complicated arguments than a simple number to the dapp (ie: when using blender for example) you should write them in the ```iexec.js``` file, [here is an example](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-dapp-samples/blob/blender/iexec.js).

If you want to go beyond submitting a work, and learn how to deploy your own dapp on the iExec platform, go check out [the ffmpeg tutorial](https://www.katacoda.com/sulliwane/scenarios/ffmpeg).

Finally, to help make the iExec SDK better, go to github [give it a star](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk), thanks!

Cheers!
