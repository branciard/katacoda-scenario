# Congratulations, you've successfully made it through this tutorial!

You are now able to submit works on any dapp from iExec Dapp Store.

In case you want to submit more complicated arguments than a simple number to the dapp (ie: if using blender) you should put them in the ```iexec.js``` file, like shown here : https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-dapp-samples/blob/blender/iexec.js

If you are interested in not just submitting work, but deploying your own dapp on the iExec platform, go check out this tutorial : https://www.katacoda.com/sulliwane/scenarios/ffmpeg

Cheers!
