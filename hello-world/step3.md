`iexec submit factorial 10`{{execute}}

 Afterwards, you can see your results with :

`iexec results`{{execute}}

It may take a moment for the computation to be completed. Repeat the last command until you can actually see the result.

Your smart contract is now "offchain computing ready!".

Sky is the limit for you and your smart contract!
