Let's submit our first calculation:

`iexec submit factorial 10`{{execute}}

Use the txHash from the submit to check the result of your submit with:

`iexec result 0x783236f489c1e4bcdfbac87475b71cd13e83266ba6d55cfb658324f281580528`{{execute}}

Be sure to replace `0x783236f...` by your txHash!  

It may take a moment for the computation to be completed. Repeat the last command until you can actually see the result.

Your smart contract is now "offchain computing ready!".

Sky is the limit for you and your smart contract!
