Let's submit our first calculation:

`iexec submit factorial 10`{{execute}}

Use the txHash from the submit to check the result of your submit with:

`iexec result 0x783236f489c1e4bcdfbac87475b71cd13e83266ba6d55cfb658324f281580528`{{execute}}

Be sure to replace `0x783236f...` by your txHash!  

It may take a moment for the computation to be completed. Repeat the last command until you can actually see the result.

You can also go to the iexec explorer to see your transaction :
https://explorer.iex.ec in the "last submissions" tab.

Your smart contract is now "offchain computing ready!".

Sky is the limit for you and your smart contract!
